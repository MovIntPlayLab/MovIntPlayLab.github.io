# MovIntPlayLab

A design & research program focused on Embodied Interaction, Technology, and Play design. We design movement-based experiences for play, physical activity, and training supported by technology. 

This program is part of the [Interactive Systems Group (DEI) lab ](https://dei.inf.uc3m.es/portal/), in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.uc3m.es/computer-science-engineering-department/home) at [Universidad Carlos III de Madrid](https://www.uc3m.es/Home). 

## Essential aspects
### Holistic design perspective & key design resources

We design experiences, not just technology. Sure, we design technology as part of that, but the technology is just one design material we work with. We consider as design materials the following: 

* non-technological objects
* the space where the action takes place
* social elements, like the number of people involved, their roles, and social dynamics
* activity’s goals, rules, obstacles, and means to achieve goals
* and much more!

### Activity-centered design

We design interactive experiences targeting the activity behind those experiences. We design keeping an eye on the overarching activity but focusing primarily on essential actions at the core of those activities. Inspired by game design, we call them embodied core mechanics, with “embodied” highlighting the physical, social, and spatial aspects of those essential actions. 

### Participatory design

We design with:
* other designers, engineers, and researchers 
* our target audience, experts of what they need and what works for them
* and with domain experts, very often trainers, physiotherapists, and movement experts


### Embodied Design Methods (EDM) & Play(fulness)

Embodied design methods are those that employ the body, in static and in motion; and the body and sensory experience to understand situations and to ideate. We use the body in interaction with other bodies and with other elements or design resources, including the space, and tech and non-tech elements. 

The embodied design methods we employ typically have a strong play and playful flavor. Play and playfulness help us to open our minds, and trigger curiosity, exploration and subversion. It supports meaning-making, and learning, as well as individual and collaborative ideation and creation. 

In MovIntPlayLab, we employ and create such methods to:

* understand the design context we target, the people we design for, and what they might do, need, and feel like
* to come up with innovative design ideas
* to design, prototype, and iterate our designs. 

## Example experiences we co-design
* Therapy exercises for the elderly involving wearable technology, or robots; 
* Circus training sessions for children with sensory-based motor disorder using wearables 
* Wearables for a live-action role play game to support pro-social behavior and interaction
* A mixed reality training experience for surgeons in training providing guidance and feedback
* Ideation sessions with participants with mixed backgrounds using technology and non-technological probes to support creativity and sensory exploration

##  Technology we work with 

We have worked with very diverse technology, from mobile technology to robots. Often we use technology that senses movement, and biofeedback, and actuates on the sensing body through haptics, visuals and audio feedback. 

Lately, our focus is on wearable technology, i.e. technology you wear on your body, like a watch, belt, necklace, or scarf. We are also working with extended reality (VR, AR…)

# Funding 
Several projects and initiatives are currently funding this program. 

The program is mainly funded by the Madrid Government (Comunidad de Madrid) under the Multiannual Agreement with UC3M in the line of "Research Funds for Beatriz Galindo Fellowships" (MovIntPlayLab-CM-UC3M) and in the context of the V PRICIT (Regional Programme of Research and Technological Innovation)".

Other synergistic projects also support this program. Currently: the [Erasmus+ MeCaMInD project](https://www.mecamind.eu/project.php): The Method Cards for Movement-based Interaction Design (2020-1-DK01- KA203-075164), focused on studying and creating movement-based methods and tools to support technology design targeting the moving body.
